# 🚀 Quick Start - Eternal AI News Aggregator

## ✅ Fixes Applied & Pushed

All necessary fixes have been committed and pushed to GitHub:
- ✅ Added `collector/__init__.py` (makes collector a package)
- ✅ Fixed `collector/generate_news.py` (sets sys.path before imports)
- ✅ Updated `webapp/script.js` (auto-detects correct URL)
- ✅ Latest commit: `6dcfd68`

**Import Error Fixed!** The sys.path is now set correctly before any imports.
